## Design

## Colours
<img src="./readme-images/Screenshot 2022-08-26 at 23.25.19.png">
The colour scheme was chosen as there is a nice contrast between diffrent elements which makes for a pleasurable user experience. The colour scheme plays a role in helping the user feel familiar with the site as the gradient used is similar to instagram just with diffrent colours. The fade from dark green to bright green in the background is like instagrams gradient from dark purple to bright pink.


## Fonts
The fonts implemented on the site are Fira sans with sans-serif as a fallback. The fonts were used thoughout the site to add charachter, style and legibility

This Django application has been deployed from GitHub to Heroku by following the steps:

Installing Django and deploying to heroku

- 1. In the Terminal: Install Django and gunicorn: pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
- 2. In the Terminal: Install supporting libraries: pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
- 3. In the Terminal: Install Cloudinary Libraries pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
- 3. In the Terminal: Create requirements file pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
- 4. In the Terminal: Create Project (Reel): django-admin startproject Reel.
- 5. In the Terminal: Create App (blog) python3 manage.py startapp Post
- 6. Settings.py: Add to installed appsINSTALLED_APPS = ['Reel',] *Save file*
- 7. In the Terminal: Migrate Changes: python3 manage.py migrate
- 8. In the Terminal: Run Server to Test python3 manage.py runserver

Step 2: Deploying an app to Heroku

- 2.1 Create the Heroku app In heroku.com: create account/ login
- 2.2 Create new Heroku App Reel, Location = Europe
- 2.3 Add Database to App Resources Located in the Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add e.g. ‘Heroku Postgres’
- 2.4Copy DATABASE_URL value: Located in the Settings Tab, click reveal Config Vars, Copy Text
- 2.5 Attach the Database: In gitpod, Create new env.py file on top level directory
- 2.6 In env.py Import os library, import os
- 2.7 Set environment variables os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "Paste in Heroku DATABASE_URL Link"
- 2.8. Add in secret key os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "Make up your own randomSecretKey"
- 2.9 In heroku.com: Add Secret Key to Config Vars SECRET_KEY, “randomSecretKey”

step 3: Prepare environment and settings.py file
- 3.1 In settings.py: Reference env.py from pathlib import Path, import os, import dj_database_url
```
if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
   import env
```
- 3.2 Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on HerokuSECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
- 3.2 Comment out the old DataBases Section
- 3.3 Add new DATABASES Section
```
DATABASES = {
   'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```
3.4 In the Terminal: Save all files and Make Migrations
```
$python3 manage.py migrate
```
- 3.5 Get  static and media files stored on Cloudinary In Cloudinary.com: register/login
- 3.6 Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL e.g. API Environment Variable. From Cloudinary Dashboard Into  env.py:
- 3.7 Add Cloudinary URL to env.py
```
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://************************"
```
- 3.8 In Heroku: Add Cloudinary URL to Heroku Config Vars Add to Settings tab in Config Vars e.g. COUDINARY_URL, cloudinary://************************
- 3.9 Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to Heroku Config Vars (temporary step for the moment, will be removed before deployment)e.g. DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, 1
- 4.0 In settings.py: Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    …,
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    …,
]
```
- 4.1. Tell Django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files
Place under the Static files Note
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```
- 4.2 Link file to the templates directory in Heroku Place under the BASE_DIR line
```
TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
```
- 4.3 Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR, Place within the TEMPLATES array
- 4.4 Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["reel.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]
```
- 4.5 In Gitpod: Create 3 new folders on top level directory media, static, templates
- 4.6 Create procfile on the top level directory
- 4.7 In Procfile: Add code web: gunicorn Reel.wsgi
- 4.8 In the Terminal: Add, Commit and Push
- 4.9 In Heroku: Deploy Content manually through heroku
- 5.0 in heroku: setup and configure automatic deployments linked to Github account
