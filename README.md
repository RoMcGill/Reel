## Design

## Colours
the colour scheme was chosen as there is a nice contrast between diffrent elements which makes for a pleasurable user experience also the colour schem plays a role in helping the user feel familiar with the site as the gradient used is similar to instagram just with the colours changedm, the fade from dark green to bright green in the background is like instagrams gradient from dark purple to bright pink.

## Fonts
***all fonts are standard at the time of writing this.***


## Structure
ease of use was the goal for this site. the navagation bar at ther top of the page provides easy clikable links to each section of the site, from there you can dive deeper into other features of the site.
