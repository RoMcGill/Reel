## Design

## Colours
<img src="./readme-images/Screenshot 2022-08-26 at 23.25.19.png">
the colour scheme was chosen as there is a nice contrast between diffrent elements which makes for a pleasurable user experience also the colour schem plays a role in helping the user feel familiar with the site as the gradient used is similar to instagram just with diffrent colours, the fade from dark green to bright green in the background is like instagrams gradient from dark purple to bright pink.


## Fonts
The fonts implemented on the site are Fira sans with sans-serif as a fallback these fonts were used thoughout the site to add charachter, style and legibility


## Structure
